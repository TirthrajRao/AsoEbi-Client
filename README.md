# AsoEbi-Client
## About this project ##

### What is Aso ebi collections platform? ###

Families usually help fund celebrating their life events through the culture of aso ebi (literally means clothes of the family).  The family chooses fabric (either locally made or imported, sometimes with the help of a fabric retailer or wholesaler). The chosen fabric is then sold at a much much higher price than purchase cost.

The culture of aso ebi spans across the various cultures of Nigeria. Events usually have fabric selected for male and female respectively; as well as for friends of parents and friends of the couple (in the case of weddings). Hence, an 
event may have up to 4 aso ebi, especially when any of the celebrants belong to societies and members of that group want to stand out from other party guests
